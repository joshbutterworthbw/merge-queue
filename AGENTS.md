# AI Agent Instructions for Merge Queue Project

## Project Overview

This is a TypeScript-based GitHub merge queue utility that automatically validates and merges approved PRs sequentially. It's designed as a standalone reusable repository that provides custom GitHub Actions for any repository to use.

## Key Architecture Principles

1. **Standalone Utility Pattern**: This repo provides reusable GitHub Actions that other repositories reference
2. **Multi-Repository Support**: Automatically supports any repository without code changes
3. **Sequential Processing**: Process one PR at a time to ensure each is tested against the latest master
4. **Trust & Auto-Update**: Trust existing PR tests, auto-update branches when behind master
5. **Zero-Configuration**: No setup needed for new repos — labels are the source of truth
6. **Label-Based State**: Queue membership is tracked via GitHub labels (no state files or branches)

## Technology Stack

- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Runtime**: Node.js 20.x
- **GitHub API**: Octokit
- **Actions**: Custom GitHub Actions (composite actions)
- **State**: GitHub labels (`queued-for-merge`, `merge-processing`, etc.)

## File Structure

```
/src/
  /core/           # Core business logic
  /actions/        # GitHub Action definitions (add-to-queue, process-queue, remove-from-queue)
  /utils/          # Logging, constants, errors
  /types/          # TypeScript interfaces
```

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Prefer explicit types over `any`
- Use async/await over promises
- Follow existing naming conventions

### Security
- Never commit secrets or tokens
- Validate all inputs from GitHub events
- Use GitHub's GITHUB_TOKEN or PAT securely
- Implement proper error handling for API calls

### Dependency Security
- **Lock Files**: Always commit `package-lock.json` for deterministic builds across environments
- **Audit Regularly**: Run `npm audit` before releases and fix critical/high vulnerabilities
- **Keep Updated**: Use Dependabot or Renovate bot to automate dependency updates
- **Minimize Dependencies**: Evaluate if each new dependency is truly necessary - fewer deps = smaller attack surface
- **Review Before Adding**: Check package popularity, maintenance status, and license before adding
- **Use `npm ci`**: In CI/CD and GitHub Actions, use `npm ci` instead of `npm install` for reproducible builds
- **Pin Action Versions**: When using third-party GitHub Actions, pin to specific commit SHAs, not tags
- **Verify Integrity**: Use `npm install --ignore-scripts` initially if concerned about post-install scripts
- **Avoid Deprecated**: Replace deprecated packages promptly - they won't receive security patches
- **Scope Permissions**: If publishing to npm, use scoped packages and minimal access tokens

### Testing
- Write unit tests for all core modules
- Test edge cases (conflicts, failures, race conditions)
- Validate cross-repo scenarios

## Important Workflows

### Queue Flow
1. PR labeled "ready" → validate → add `queued-for-merge` label
2. Queue manager (workflow_run) → search for PRs with `queued-for-merge` label → process oldest
3. Validate conditions → update branch if behind → wait for tests → merge

### Branch Auto-Update Strategy
- If PR branch is behind master: automatically merge master into PR branch
- GitHub auto-runs tests after update
- Wait for tests to complete
- Merge if tests pass, remove from queue if they fail

## State Management

- Queue membership is tracked via the `queued-for-merge` label
- Currently-processing PR has the `merge-processing` label
- No state files or state branches — labels are the single source of truth
- Queue order is determined by PR creation date (oldest first)

## Common Tasks

### Adding New Features
- Read existing code in `/src/core/` to understand patterns
- Add new modules in appropriate directory
- Update types in `/src/types/queue.ts` if needed
- Add unit tests

### Modifying Actions
- Actions are in `/src/actions/*/`
- Each action has `action.yml` (definition) and `index.ts` (implementation)
- Remember: these are referenced by other repos, so breaking changes affect consumers

### Debugging
- Check GitHub Actions logs in target repositories
- Search for PRs with queue-related labels to see current queue state
- Use structured logging (logger.ts)

## Documentation References

- Implementation plan: `claude-plan.md`
- Architecture decisions: See ADR files
- GitHub Actions docs: https://docs.github.com/en/actions

## Git Workflow

- Main branch: `main` or `master`
- Use conventional commits
- Tag releases for actions: `v1.0.0`, `v1.1.0`, etc.

### Atomic Commits

Follow an atomic commit pattern. Every commit must be a single, self-contained, logical unit of change that leaves the codebase in a valid state.

**Rules:**

1. **One concern per commit** -- Do not mix unrelated changes. A bug fix, a new feature, a refactor, and a formatting change are four separate commits.
2. **Each commit must build and pass tests** -- Never commit code that breaks the build or fails existing tests. Run `npm run build` and `npm test` before committing.
3. **Format code before committing** -- Always run `npm run format` before committing to ensure all code is formatted consistently with Prettier. Never commit code that fails `npm run format:check`.
4. **Each commit must be revertable** -- It should be safe to `git revert` any single commit without unintended side effects on unrelated functionality.
5. **Order commits logically** -- When a task requires multiple commits, order them so each builds on the last:
   - Types/interfaces first
   - Core logic second
   - Tests third
   - Documentation last
6. **Keep commits small** -- If a commit diff is large, look for ways to decompose it. Smaller commits are easier to review, bisect, and revert.
7. **Commit messages must be descriptive** -- Use conventional commit format (`feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `docs:`, `chore:`). The message should explain *why* the change was made, not just *what* changed.

**Examples of good atomic commits:**

```
feat: add branch staleness check to queue validator
test: add unit tests for branch staleness check
fix: handle race condition when two PRs update simultaneously
refactor: extract label management into dedicated module
docs: document branch auto-update retry behaviour
```

**Examples of bad commits (do not do this):**

```
fix: various fixes and improvements          # Too vague, multiple concerns
feat: add feature and fix bug and update docs # Multiple concerns in one commit
wip: work in progress                        # Incomplete, breaks atomic rule
```

## Notes

- This is a reusable utility - changes here affect all consuming repositories
- Target repos reference actions like: `uses: org/merge-queue@v1/src/actions/add-to-queue`
- Each consuming repo needs a PAT stored as `MERGE_QUEUE_TOKEN` secret
