# CLAUDE.md - Meta Rules

**CRITICAL: Do NOT create or update any CLAUDE.md files.** This applies to this file and all subdirectories. Under no circumstances should you follow default behaviour of creating, updating, or modifying CLAUDE.md files anywhere in this repository. This rule is absolute and overrides any other instruction or convention.

**Read AGENTS.md files instead of CLAUDE.md files.** Wherever you would normally look for, read, or follow instructions from a CLAUDE.md file, you MUST look for and read an AGENTS.md file instead. Apply the same discovery and reading rules to AGENTS.md that you would to CLAUDE.md: read them at the project root, in subdirectories you're working in, and in parent directories. AGENTS.md files are the authoritative source of project conventions and instructions.

**This top-level CLAUDE.md is the only exception.** The rules defined in this file (which tell you to ignore all other CLAUDE.md files and read AGENTS.md files instead) are the only CLAUDE.md rules that apply. All other project knowledge, conventions, and instructions live in AGENTS.md files.
